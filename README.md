# SwiftAutoCompleteMVC
This is a small piece of code to implement Auto Complete in a Text Field with Google Places API.
One can just drag & drop the classes and call the Google API in the View Controller.
It is based on MVC and Delegate design pattern.

Run the application and start using this component!
